YARN is a resource management and job scheduling component in Hadoop. It manages and allocates resources to different applications running on the cluster, enabling efficient utilization of cluster resources.

* **Hadoop Common:**
This includes libraries, utilities, and APIs used by various Hadoop modules. It provides a consistent and shared infrastructure for Hadoop components.

* **Hadoop Ecosystem**
Apart from the core components, the Hadoop ecosystem consists of various complementary projects and tools that extend the capabilities of Hadoop. These include tools for data ingestion (Apache Flume, Apache Kafka), data processing (Apache Pig, Apache Hive), data querying (Apache Drill, Apache Impala), and more.



Following are the versions introduced by Apache Hadoop:

* **Hadoop 1.x (2006-2012):**
  The initial release of Hadoop focused on introducing the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and the MapReduce programming model. It provided a scalable way to process and store large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware.

* **Hadoop 2.x (2012-2013):**

-------------------------------------------------

### 4. What is GFS - Google File System?
The Google File System (GFS) is a proprietary distributed file system developed by Google to manage and store large amounts of data across clusters of commodity hardware. It was designed to meet Google's specific needs for handling vast amounts of data efficiently and reliably, and it served as a foundation for many of Google's services, including Google Search, Google Maps, and Gmail.


![gfs picture](./assets/gfs.jpg)

Key characteristics of the Google File System include:

* **Scalability:** GFS is designed to scale to accommodate enormous amounts of data. It achieves this by distributing data across multiple storage servers in a cluster, enabling the system to handle petabytes of data across thousands of machines.

* **Fault Tolerance:** GFS is built to operate on commodity hardware, which is prone to failures. It addresses this challenge through data replication. Files are divided into fixed-size chunks, and each chunk is replicated across multiple machines. If one machine fails, the system can retrieve the data from another replica.

* **Simplified Interface:** GFS provides a simplified file system interface, optimized for large files and streaming reads and writes. It sacrifices certain features found in traditional file systems to achieve greater performance and efficiency for Google's workloads.

* **Data Locality:** GFS is designed to take advantage of data locality, meaning that data is stored close to the computation that needs it. This reduces network congestion and speeds up data processing.

* **Master-Chunkserver Architecture:** GFS architecture includes a single master server that manages metadata (such as file namespaces, access control, and location information) and multiple chunk servers responsible for storing and serving data chunks.

It's important to note that GFS is not open source and is proprietary to Google. However, its design principles and concepts have influenced the development of various open-source distributed file systems and storage solutions, including the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and other similar systems.


### Comparison of GFS / HDFS

### 5. What is YARN in hadoop context?
YARN stands for "Yet Another Resource Negotiator," is a key component in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. It was introduced in Hadoop 2.x to address limitations in the original Hadoop MapReduce framework's resource management and job scheduling capabilities. YARN essentially separates the resource management and job scheduling aspects, enabling Hadoop to support a broader range of processing frameworks beyond just MapReduce.

In the context of Hadoop, YARN serves as a resource management layer that efficiently allocates and manages resources across a cluster, enabling different applications to run concurrently and share cluster resources effectively. 

Here's how YARN works within the Hadoop ecosystem:

* **Resource Management:** YARN manages the physical resources (CPU, memory, etc.) of the cluster's nodes. It keeps track of available resources and allocates them to applications as needed. This enables multi-tenancy, allowing various applications to coexist on the same cluster without negatively impacting each other.

* **Application Management:** YARN allows multiple applications to run on the same cluster simultaneously. Each application runs within its own application master, which is responsible for managing its tasks, monitoring progress, and negotiating resource requirements.

* **Job Scheduling:** YARN's ResourceManager handles the allocation of resources based on the resource requirements of applications. It makes scheduling decisions based on fairness and capacity, ensuring optimal resource utilization across the cluster.

* **NodeManager:** Each node in the cluster runs a NodeManager process, responsible for monitoring resource usage on the node and reporting this information to the ResourceManager. It also manages the execution of tasks requested by the ApplicationMaster.

With YARN, Hadoop clusters became more versatile and efficient. In addition to running MapReduce jobs, Hadoop 2.x and later versions can host various other processing frameworks that can share resources in a more flexible manner. This enables a wide range of applications, including real-time data processing (like Apache Spark and Apache Flink), interactive querying (like Apache Tez), and more, to be seamlessly integrated into the Hadoop ecosystem.


-------------------------------------------------

### 6. What is MapReduce ? Solve an example also.

MapReduce is a programming model and processing paradigm designed for processing and generating large-scale datasets across distributed computing clusters. It was popularized by Google and became a fundamental concept in the Hadoop ecosystem. The idea behind MapReduce is to break down a complex data processing task into smaller subtasks that can be executed in parallel across multiple nodes in a cluster.

The MapReduce model consists of two main phases: the "Map" phase and the "Reduce" phase.

* **Map Phase:**
 In this phase, the input data is divided into chunks, and each chunk is processed independently by a "Map" function. The "Map" function takes the input data, applies a transformation to it, and emits key-value pairs as intermediate output.

* **Shuffle and Sort:**
 After the "Map" phase, the intermediate key-value pairs are shuffled and sorted based on their keys. This step groups together all intermediate values associated with the same key, preparing the data for the next phase.

* **Reduce Phase:**
 In the "Reduce" phase, the shuffled and sorted intermediate key-value pairs are processed by the "Reduce" function. The "Reduce" function takes a key and a list of values associated with that key, applies some computation to those values, and generates final output data.

![mapreducer picture](./assets/mapreduce.png)


**Example:**

Problem: *Calculate the average score of students from a dataset containing student names and their corresponding scores.*

**Map Phase:**

Input: 
    
    ("Alice", 85), ("Bob", 92), ("Alice", 78), ("Bob", 90), ("Charlie", 75)

Map Function:

    Map("Alice", 85) -> ("Alice", 85)
    
    Map("Bob", 92) -> ("Bob", 92)
    
    Map("Alice", 78) -> ("Alice", 78)
    
    Map("Bob", 90) -> ("Bob", 90)
    
    Map("Charlie", 75) -> ("Charlie", 75)

Shuffle and Sort:

Intermediate Key-Value Pairs: 

    ("Alice", [85, 78]), ("Bob", [92, 90]), ("Charlie", [75])



**Reduce Phase:**

Reduce Function:
 
    Reduce("Alice", [85, 78]) -> ("Alice", 81.5)
    
    Reduce("Bob", [92, 90]) -> ("Bob", 91.0)
    
    Reduce("Charlie", [75]) -> ("Charlie", 75.0)

**Output:**

    "Alice" has an average score of 81.5.
    
    "Bob" has an average score of 91.0.
    
    "Charlie" has an average score of 75.0.


In this example, the MapReduce paradigm effectively calculates the average score for each student by distributing the data processing across multiple nodes and aggregating the results.

RDDs provide fault tolerance through lineage information, enabling lost data to be reconstructed in case of node failures.

* **Data Transformation and Analysis:** Spark provides a rich set of operators for data transformation and analysis, such as map, reduce, filter, join, and more. These operators allow developers to express complex data processing pipelines more intuitively.

* **Spark SQL:** Spark includes a module for processing structured and semi-structured data using SQL queries. This makes it easier for analysts and data scientists familiar with SQL to work with big data.

* **Machine Learning and Graph Processing:** Spark's MLlib library offers machine learning algorithms that can work with large datasets. Additionally, GraphX provides a graph processing library for graph-based data analysis.

* **Streaming:** Spark Streaming allows real-time processing of data streams. This is useful for applications like monitoring social media, processing log files, or real-time analytics.

* **Cluster Manager Integration:** Spark can be integrated with various cluster managers, such as Apache Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, or it can be run in standalone mode.


While Spark can be used independently, it's often employed alongside Hadoop, where HDFS is used as a storage layer for the data and Spark is used for more efficient and faster data processing. This combination leverages the strengths of both frameworks, utilizing Spark's in-memory processing and Hadoop's distributed storage capabilities.
